					<h5 class="card-title">About:
					<p class="card-text">Chief Amy Santiago is a main character of the show. She is a Chief of Department, former sergeant and a former detective at the 99th precinct of the NYPD. Always eager to impress, Amy is looking for a mentor to help her achieve her dream of being the youngest person to be promoted to Captain.</p>
					</h5>
					<br>
					<h4 class="card-title">Personality:</h4>
					<p><i class="fa fa-map-maker"aria-hidden="true">Amy is an incredibly ambitious and driven detective who always strives for perfection in nearly everything she does. Like Jake, she is extremely competitive and stubborn, doing whatever it takes to win a bet or competition.

						Amy is utterly obsessed with anything that has to do with organization or rules, with one of her favourite pastimes even being creating binders for any given situation. She is often made fun of by others for being a “goody-two shoes”, as she has shown to be incapable of even breaking the smallest rule. Because of how much she values rules and authority, Amy upholds an unnaturally high amount of respect and reverence towards superior officers, particularly Captain Holt. This causes her to be desperate for her captain’s wisdom and approval, often to the point of coming off as awkward and off-putting.

						Due to her need to plan nearly everything in her life, Amy is easily prone to bouts of anxiety and panic when things don’t go as expected. She developed a smoking habit to help deal with her stress, of which she is deeply ashamed of. Amy’s straight-forward and uptight attitude, along with being overall more sensitive than her colleagues, has caused her to end up as the butt of many jokes, particularly from Gina.

					Nonetheless, Amy will still hold her friends to the same impossible standards she sets for herself, which again leads to her coming off as overbearing. Despite this, Amy is a genuinely kind and caring person who is always looking out for her fellow officers, not hesitating to help them out with their issues. Though generally the one to get pushed around, Amy is not incapable of standing up for herself or her friends when needed, and can become incredibly assertive. Despite frequently being made fun of, Amy is credited as being one of the most talented and competent detectives in the 99th precinct, and has displayed great leadership abilities when required.</i></p>
					<p><i class="fa fa-map-maker"aria-hidden="true">Amy comes from a Cuban-American family. She has seven brothers and at least one niece. She is either her parents' 2nd, 3rd, or 4th favourite child.[3] Her father was a police officer. Her highly competitive trait comes from him.[4]

As a child, Amy excelled enough in school to skip the 4th grade entirely. She attended a magnet school, where she was voted "most likely to befriend a school administrator." In 8th grade, she was given the key to the teacher's lounge, where she stocked the fridge and cleaned up after the teachers. During high school, Amy was voted "Most Appropriate." She was the president of the Stenographer's Club in her school because she was the only member.[5] She became a student chaperone in middle school and kept up this role for the rest of her education.

In college, Amy studied art history. She went to a weekend-long math conference called "Funky Cats and their Feisty Stats".[6] She once pooped her pants during an AP exam, which she admits and jokes about in Cinco de Mayo.

Amy has one friend named Kylie who frequently set her up on dates before she started dating Jake Peralta.

In The Puzzle Master, Amy passed the exam required to became a sergeant. She officially becomes a Sergeant in NutriBoom, making her the first female sergeant in her district's history.</p>
